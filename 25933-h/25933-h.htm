<h2>Prefatory.</h2>

<p>"Anybody," said an astute lawyer, addressing the jury to whom the
opposing counsel had reflected upon inaccuracies in the spelling of his
brief&mdash;"anybody can write English correctly, but surely a man may be
allowed to spell a word in two or three different ways if he likes!"
This was a claim for independence of action which so commended itself to
the jury that it won a verdict for his client.
<span class="pagenum">[Pg. 6]</span>
The same plea may be
considered in regard to the truly wonderful way in which the
mother-tongue is often written, by the educated sometimes as well as by
the uneducated.</p>

<p>A man, it may be urged, has a right to spell as he chooses, and to
express his ideas, when he has any, as best he can; while, when he
suffers from a dearth of those rare articles, he has still more reason
to rejoice in liberty of choice in respect to the language he selects to
cover his poverty of thought. Hence there are doubtless good and
sufficient reasons for every specimen of "English as she is wrote,"
<span class="pagenum">[Pg. 7]</span>
which it is the object of this little book to rescue from oblivion, and
which have, one and all, been written with the sober conviction, upon
the part of the writers, that they accurately conveyed the meaning they
desired. Intentionally humorous efforts have been carefully excluded,
and the interest of the collection consists in the spontaneity of
expression and in the fact that it offers fair samples of the
possibilities which lie hidden in the orthography and construction of
our language. Let it be remembered, then, that <span class="normal
smcap">anybody</span> can
write English as she "should be wrote," and hence that a certain meed of
admiration is due to those who, exercising their right of independent
<span class="pagenum">[Pg. 8]</span>
action, succeed in making it at once original and racy, and in
conveying, without the least effort, meanings totally opposed to their
intention, affording thereby admirable examples of English as "she is
wrote" by thousands.</p>

<span class="bold fs150">By the Inaccurate.</span>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">In</span> the account of an inaugural ceremony it was asserted that "the
procession was very fine, and nearly two miles long, as was also the
report of Dr. Perry, the chaplain."</p>

<p>A Western paper says: "A child was run over by a wagon three years old,
and cross-eyed, with pantalets on, which never spoke afterward."</p>

<div class="pagenum">[Pg. 10]</div>

<p>Here is some descriptive evidence of personal peculiarities:</p>
<ul class="in1em">
<li>"A fellow was arrested with short hair."</li>
<li>"I saw a man digging a well with a Roman nose."</li>
<li>"A house was built by a mason of brown stone."</li>
<li>"Wanted&mdash;A room by two gentlemen thirty feet long and twenty
feet wide."</li>
<li>"A man from Africa called to pay his compliments tall and
dark-complexioned."</li>
<li>"I perceived that it had been scoured with half an eye."</li>
</ul>

<p>A sea-captain once asserted that his "vessel was beautifully painted
with a tall mast."</p>

<p>In an account of travels we are assured that "a pearl was found by a
sailor in a shell."</p>

<p>A bill presented to a farmer ran thus: "To hanging two barn doors and
myself, 4<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>"</p>

<div class="pagenum">[Pg. 11]</div>

<p>A store-keeper assures his customers that "the longest time and easiest
terms are given by any other house in the city."</p>

<p>Here is a curious evidence of philanthropy: "A wealthy gentleman will
adopt a little boy with a small family."</p>

<p>A parochial report states that "the town farm-house and almshouse have
been carried on the past year to our reasonable satisfaction, especially
the almshouse, at which there have been an unusual amount of sickness
and three deaths."</p>

<p>A Kansas paper thus ends a marriage notice: "The couple left for the
East on the night train where they will reside."</p>

<p>In the account of a shipwreck we find the following: "The captain swam
ashore. So did the chambermaid; she was insured for a large sum and
loaded with pig-iron."</p>

<div class="pagenum">[Pg. 12]</div>

<p>A notice at the entrance to a bridge asserts that "any person driving
over this bridge in a faster pace than a walk shall, if a white person
be fined five dollars, and if a negro receive twenty-five lashes, half
the penalty to be bestowed on the informer."</p>

<p>The following notice appeared on the west end of a country
meeting-house: "Anybody sticking bills against this church will be
prosecuted according to law or any other nuisance."</p>

<p>A gushing but ungrammatical editor says: "We have received a basket of
fine grapes from our friend &mdash;&mdash;, for which he will please accept our
compliments, some of which are nearly one inch in diameter."</p>

<p>On the panel under the letter-receiver of the General Post-Office,
Dublin, these words are printed: "Post here letters too late for the
next mail."</p>

<div class="pagenum">[Pg. 13]</div>

<p>An Ohio farmer is said to have the following warning posted
conspicuously on his premises: "If any man's or woman's cows or oxen
gits in this here oats his or her tail will be cut off, as the case may
be."</p>

<p>A lady desired to communicate by electricity to her husband in the city
the size of an illuminated text which she had promised for the
Sunday-school room. When the order reached him it read, "Unto us a child
is born, nine feet long by two feet wide."</p>

<p>A farmer who wished to enter some of his live-stock at an agricultural
exhibition, in the innocence of his heart, but with more truth in his
words than he dreamed of, wrote to the committee, saying, "Enter me for
one jackass."</p>

<p>An Irishman complained to his physician that "he stuffed him so much
with drugs that he was ill a long time after he got well."</p>

<div class="pagenum">[Pg. 14]</div>

<p>A correspondent of a New York paper described Mr. C.'s journey to
Washington to attend "the dying bedside of his mother."</p>

<p>A dealer in engravings announced: "'Scotland Forever.' A Cavalry Charge
after Elizabeth Thompson Butler, just published."</p>

<p>A Western paper says that "a fine new school-house has just been
finished in that town capable of accommodating three hundred students
four stories high."</p>

<p>A coroner's verdict read thus: "The deceased came to his death by
excessive drinking, producing apoplexy in the minds of the jury."</p>

<p>An old edition of Morse's geography declares that "Albany has four
hundred dwelling-houses and twenty-four hundred inhabitants, all
standing with their gable-ends to the street."</p>

<div class="pagenum">[Pg. 15]</div>
<p>A member of a school committee writes, "We have two school-rooms
sufficiently large to accommodate three hundred pupils, one above the
other."</p>

<p>A Harrisburg paper, answering a correspondent on a question of
etiquette, says: "When a gentleman and lady are walking upon the street,
the lady should walk inside of the gentleman."</p>

<p>A clergyman writes, "A young woman died in my neighborhood yesterday,
while I was preaching the gospel in a beastly state of
intoxication."</p>

<p>A certain friendly society, which was also a sort of mutual insurance
organization, had this among its printed notices to the members: "In the
event of your death, you are requested to bring your book, policy, and
certificate at once to Mr. &mdash;&mdash;, when your claims will have immediate
attention."</p>

<div class="pagenum">[Pg. 16]</div>
<p>A New York paper, describing a funeral in Jersey City, says: "At the
ferry four friends of the deceased took possession of the carriage and
followed the remains to Evergreen Cemetery, where they were quietly
interred in a new lot without service or ceremony." The devotion of the
friends of the deceased was certainly remarkable, but one can not help
wondering what became of the remains.</p>

<p>A newspaper gives an account of a man who "was driving an old ox when he
became angry and kicked him, hitting his jawbone with such force as to
break his leg." "We have been fairly wild ever since we read the paper,"
writes a contemporary, "to know who or which got angry at whom or what,
and if the ox kicked the man's jaw with such force as to break the ox's
leg, or how it is. Or did the man kick the ox in the jawbone with such
force as to break the ox's leg, and, if so, which leg? It's one of those
<span class="pagenum">[Pg. 17]</span>
things which no man can find out, save only the man who kicked or was
being kicked, as the case may be."</p>

<p>One of Sir Boyle Roche's invitations to an Irish nobleman was rather
equivocal. He wrote, "I hope, my lord, if you ever come within a mile of
my house you will stay there all night."</p>

<p>A German tourist expresses himself in regard to his Scottish experiences
as follows: "A person angry says to-day that he was from the theatre
gallary spit upon. Very fine. I also was spit upon. Not on the dress but
into the eye strait it came with strong force while I look up angry to
the gallary. Befor I come to your country I worship the Scotland of my
books, my 'Waverly Novel,' you know, but now I dwell here since six
months, in all parts, the picture change. I now know of the bad smell,
the oath and curse of God's name, the wisky drink and the rudeness. You
<span class="pagenum">[Pg. 18]</span>
have much money here, but you want what money can not buye&mdash;heart
cultivating that makes respect for gentle things. O! to be spit in the
eye in one half million of peopled town. Let me no longer be in this
cold country, where people push in the street, blow the noze with naked
finger, empty the dish at the house door, chooze the clergy from the
lower classes and then go with them to death for an ecclesiastical
theory which none of them can understand. I go home three days time."
There is more in this than grotesque English, however. It abounds with
good sense and penetration.</p>

<p>The following is a pattern piece of modern style, sanctioned by an
English Board of Trade, and drawn up by an eminent authority: "Tickets
are nipped at the Barriers, and passengers admitted to the platforms
will have to be delivered up to the Company in event of the holders
<span class="pagenum">[Pg. 19]</span>
subsequently retiring from the platforms without travelling, and cannot
be recognized for readmission."</p>

<p>A college professor, describing the effect of the wind in some Western
forests, wrote, "In traveling along the road, I even sometimes found the
logs bound and twisted together to such an extent that a mule couldn't
climb over them, so I went round."</p>

<p>A mayor in a university town issued the following proclamation: "Whereas
a Multiplicity of Dangers are often incurred by Damage of outrageous
Accidents by Fire, we whose names are undesigned have thought proper
that the Benefit of an Engine bought by us for the better extinguishing
of which by the Accidents of Almighty God may unto us happen to make a
Rate togather Benevolence for the better propagating such useful
Instruments."</p>

slate-roofed grocer's shop, he will hear of something to his advantage,
as the same is a gift of a deceased mother now no more with the name
engraved upon it."</p>

brought up a Dissenter with his Parents, and is a sober man."</p>

an excitation brought to bear on the nasal membrane or by a sudden shock
<span class="pagenum">[Pg. 57]</span>
of the sun's rays on the membranes of the eye. This peripheral
irritation is transmitted by the trifacial nerve to the Gasserian
ganglion, whence it passes by a commissure to an agglomeration of
globules in the medulla oblongata or in the protuberance; from this
point, by a series of numerous reflex and complicated acts, it is
transformed by the mediation of the spinal cord into a centrifugal
excitation which radiates outward by means of the spinal nerves to the
expiratory muscles."</p>

<p>"I propose, then, to give your readers some description of this old
yet still strange and wild country, that has been settled for three
hundred years, and is not yet inhabited&mdash;a land of shifting sand
and deep mud&mdash;a land of noble rivers that rise in swamps and
consist merely of chains of shallow lakes, some of them twenty miles
long and two miles across, and only twelve feet deep&mdash;of wide,
sandy plains, covered with solemn-sounding pines&mdash;of spots so
barren that nothing can be made to grow upon them, and <span
class="pagenum">[Pg. 60]</span>yet with a soil
so fertile that if you tickle it with a hoe, it will laugh out an
abundant harvest of sugar, cotton, and fruit&mdash;a land of oranges,
lemons, pomegranates, pineapples, figs, and bananas; whose rivers teem
with fish, its forests with game, and its very air with fowl; where
everything will grow except apples and wheat; where everything can be
found except ice; yet where the people, with a productive soil, a mild
climate and beautiful nature, affording every table luxury, live on
corn-grist, sweet potatoes, and molasses; where men possessing forty
thousand head of cattle never saw a glass of milk in their lives, using
the imported article when used at all, and then calling it consecrated
milk; where the very effort to milk a cow would probably scare her to
death, as well as frighten a whole neighborhood by the unheard of
phenomenon; where cabbages grow on the tops of trees, and you may dig
bread out of the ground; where, below the frost-line, the
<span class="pagenum">[Pg. 61]</span>
castor-oil
plant becomes a large tree of several years' growth, and a pumpkin or
bean-vine will take root from its trailing branches, and thus spread and
live year after year; where cattle do not know what hay is, and refuse
it when offered, so that the purchase of a yoke of oxen is not
considered valid if the animals will not eat in a stable; and where in
the mild winter, when the land grass is dried up, horses and cattle may
be seen wading and swimming in the ponds and streams, plunging their
heads under water grasses and moss; where many lakes have holes in the
bottom and underground communication, so that they will sometimes shrink
away to a mere cupful, leaving many square miles of surface uncovered,
and then again fill up from below and spread out over their former area;
where some of them have outlets in the ocean far from shore, bursting up
a perpetual spring of fresh water in the very midst of the briny
saltness of the sea; <span class="pagenum">[Pg. 62]</span>
where in times of low water, during a long
exhaustive dry season, men have gone under ground in one of these
subterranean rivers, from lake to lake, a distance of eight miles; where
the ground will sometimes sink and the cavity fill with water, until
tall trees, that had stood and sunk upright, will have their topmost
branches deeply covered; where rivers will disappear in the earth and
rise again, thus forming natural bridges, some of them a mile in
breadth; where, instead of spring, summer, autumn, and winter, there are
two seasons only&mdash;eight months summer, and four months warm
weather; where the winter is the dry season, and the summer almost a
daily rain; where, in order to take a walk, you first wade through a
light sand ankle deep and then get into a mud-puddle, and some of these
mud-puddles cover a whole county; where no clay is found fit for
brick-making, and people build houses without chimneys; where to make a
living is so easy a <span class="pagenum">[Pg. 63]</span>
task, that every one possesses the laziness of ten
ordinary men, every one you wish to employ in labor says he is tired and
would seem to have been born so; where ague would prevail if the people
would take the trouble to shake; where a large orange-tree will bear
several thousand oranges&mdash;leaves, buds, blossom, half-grown and
full-grown fruit, all at once&mdash;and every twenty-five feet square of
sand will sustain such a tree; where, in many parts, cold weather is an
impossibility, and perpetual verdure reigns; where the Everglades are
found, covering many large counties with water from one to six feet
deep, with a bottom, mud covered, yet underneath solid and firm, from
which grasses grow up to the surface&mdash;a sea of green, and with
islands large and small scattered over the surface, covered with live
oaks and dense vegetation; where alligators, or gators as they are
called in Florida parlance, possess undoubted aboriginal rights <span class="pagenum">[Pg. 64]</span>
of
citizenship, and mosquitoes pay constant visits and are instructive and
even penetrating in their attention to strangers."</p></blockquote>

<p>An Irish paper contained this account of Mrs. Siddons's
appearance:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"On Sunday, Mrs. Siddons, about whom all the world has been talking,
exposed her beautiful, adamantine, soft, and lovely person, for the
first time at Smock Alley Theatre in the bewitching, melting, and all
tearful character of Isabella. From the repeated panegyrics of the
impartial London newspapers, we were taught to expect the sight of a
heavenly angel, but how were we supernaturally surprised into almost
awful joy at beholding a mortal goddess! The house was crowded with
hundreds more than it could hold, with thousands of admiring spectators
who went away without a sight. This extraordinary phenomenon of tragic
excellence! this star of Melpomene! <span class="pagenum">[Pg. 65]</span>
this comet of the stage! this sun of
the firmament of the Muses! this moon of blank verse! this queen and
princess of tears! this Donellan of the poisoned dagger! this empress of
pistol and dagger! this chaos of Shakespeare! this world of weeping
clouds! this Juno commanding aspects! this Terpsichore of the curtains
and scenes! this Proserpine of fire and excitement! this Katterfelto of
wonders! exceeded expectation, went beyond belief and soared above all
the natural powers of description! She was nature itself! She was the
most exquisite work of art! She was the very daisy, primrose, tuberose,
sweet brier, furze blossom, gilliflower, wall flower, cauliflower,
auricula, and rosemary! In short, she was the bouquet of Parnassus! When
expectations were so high, it was thought she would be injured by her
appearance, but it was the audience who were injured: several fainted
before the curtain drew up! When she came to <span class="pagenum">[Pg. 66]</span>
the scene of parting with
her wedding ring, ah! what a sight was there! the very fiddlers in the
orchestra, albeit unused to melting mood, blubbered like hungry children
crying for their bread and butter! and when the bell rang for music
between the acts the tears ran from the bassoon players' eyes in such
plentiful showers that they choked the finger stops, and making a spout
of the instrument poured in such torrents on the first fiddler's book
that not seeing the overture was in two sharps, the leader of the band
played it in one flat. But the sobs and sighs of the groaning audience
and the noise of corks drawn from smelling bottles prevented the
mistakes between sharps and flats being heard. One hundred and nine
ladies fainted! forty-six went into fits! and ninety-five had strong
hysterics. The world will scarcely credit the truth when they are told
that fourteen children, five old men, one hundred tailors, and six
common councilmen were actually <span class="pagenum">[Pg. 67]</span>
drowned in the inundation of tears that
flowed from the galleries, the slips, and the boxes, to increase the
briny pond in the pit. The water was three feet deep. An Act of
Parliament will certainly be passed against her playing any
more!"</p></blockquote>

was desired to condense into prose these immortal verses. Urgently

<p>"Mary, a female, judged to be of the race of man, whose family name is
unknown, whether of native or foreign birth, of lofty or lowly lineage,
and whose appearance, manners, and mental cultivation are involved in
the most profound mystery, which probably will never be fully
ascertained unless through the most profound researches of an historian
admirably trained in his profession, who shall devote the ablest efforts
of his life to the investigation of the subject, uninfluenced by either
passion or prejudice, and having only in view the sacred truth, at the
same time being utterly regardless of the plaudits or censures of the
world, we are informed by one who, it has been stated, at one time while
living in that part of the United States of America known as
Massachusetts, whose fishermen have frequently been involved in
difficulties with the authorities of her Majesty Queen Victoria, Queen
of Great Britain and Empress of the Indies, whose domains <span class="pagenum">[Pg. 69]</span>
extended over
a large share of the habitable globe, thereby endangering the peace
which should so happily exist between nations of the same blood and
language, had an infant sheep, of which there are many millions of
various stocks and qualities now in our country, constantly adding
wealth and prosperity to our republic, and enabling us to be entirely
independent of all other nations for our supply of wool, now ample for
the use of factories already busily employed, and for those which ere
long will be constructed in all parts of our land, working both by water
and steam power, and in whatever direction the said Mary traveled, this
animal, whose fleece was snow-white, even as the lofty mountain-regions
in the silent solitudes of eternal winter, as the ethereal vapors which
oft float over an autumnal sky, 'darkly, deeply, beautifully blue' or as
the lacteal fluid covered with masses of delicate froth, found in the
buckets of the rosy dairymaid, whether meandering through the meadows in
<span class="pagenum">[Pg. 70]</span>
midsummer, gathering the luscious strawberry, strolling in the woodland
paths in search of wild flowers, visiting the church with her uncles,
cousins, and aunts, to listen to the inspired words which come from the
lips of the minister of the sanctuary, or when retiring to her blissful
couch to seek rest and enjoy sweet repose after the cares and labors of
the day; in fact, 'everywhere that Mary went' this youthful sheep,
influenced doubtless by that affection which is oft so conspicuously
manifested by the lower animals in their association with human beings,
was ever observed to accompany her."</p>

<p>While upon the subject of puns, we might quote the following, clipped
from the "Graphic":</p>

<p>"On being consulted about it Spikes says that Uncle Sam aunticipates the
transfer of the Indian Bureau to some mother department, and if this
should father improve the condition of the children of the forest, in
sondry ways, by cousin them to be more comfortable, it would be a niece
arrangement and daughter be made." We are inclined, in nephew instances,
<span class="pagenum">[Pg. 86]</span>
to agree with the gramma, but not the spelling.</p>

<p>The "Graphic" is also responsible for the following English stanza
transformed into Russian, said to have been found in a room after it had
been vacated by Alexis while in this country. It is introduced as an
example of how "she can be oddly wrote":</p>

<p>The following clever paraphrase of the old rhythmic story of "Jack's
House" is a good illustration of the scope and flexibility of our
<span class="pagenum">[Pg. 87]</span>
language, and suggests the fact that tautological errors of writing need
seldom be committed.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Care</span> should be taken in writing for the young, or they may get a wholly
different meaning from the language than that intended. The Bishop of
Hereford was examining a school-class one day, and, among other things,
asked what an average was. Several boys pleaded ignorance, but one at
last replied, "It is what a hen lays on." This answer puzzled the bishop
not a little; but the boy persisted in it, stating that he had read it
in his little book of facts. He was then told to bring the little book,
and, on doing so, he pointed triumphantly to a paragraph commencing,
<span class="pagenum">[Pg. 92]</span>
"The domestic hen lays <i>on an average</i> fifty eggs each year."</p>

<p>If English is "wrote" as she is often "spoke" by the ignorant and
careless, she would bear little resemblance to the original Queen's
English. A listener wrote out a short conversation heard the other day
between two pupils of a high-school, and here is the phonetic
result:</p>
<div class="lineheight-half">
<p>"Warejergo lasnight?"</p>

</div>

<p>Here, as they took different streets, their conversation ceased.</p>

<p>A writer in the "School-boy Magazine" has gathered together the
following dictionary words as defined by certain small people:</p>

<ul>
<li>Bed-time&mdash;Shut eye time.</li>
<li>Dust&mdash;Mud with the juice squeezed out.</li>
<li>Fan&mdash;A thing to brush warm off with.</li>
<li>Fins&mdash;A fish's wings.</li>
<li>Ice&mdash;Water that staid out in the cold and went to sleep.</li>

<li class="pagenum">[Pg. 94]</li>
<li>Snoring&mdash;Letting off sleep.</li>
<li>Stars&mdash;The moon's eggs.</li>
<li>Wakefulness&mdash;Eyes all the time coming unbuttoned.</li>
</ul>

<p>The following specimens from scholars' examinations in making sentences
to illustrate the definitions of words, found in their small
dictionaries, will have a familiar sound to some of our readers:</p>

<ul>
<li>Frantic = Wild: I picked a bouquet of frantic flowers.</li>
<li>Retorted = Returned: We retorted home at six o'clock.</li>
<li>Summoned = Called: I summoned to see Mary last week.</li>
<li>Athletic = Strong: The vinegar was too athletic to be used.</li>
<li>Poignant = Sharp: My knife is very poignant.</li>
<li>Ordinances = Rules: We learned the ordinances for finding the greatest common divisor.</li>
<li><span class="pagenum">[Pg. 95]</span></li>
<li>Turbid = Muddy: The road was so turbid that we stuck fast in the mud.</li>
<li>Tandem = One behind another: The scholars sit tandem in school.</li>
<li>Akimbo = With a crook: I saw a dog with an akimbo in his tail.</li>
<li>Atonement = Satisfaction: There is no atonement in boat-riding in a cold day.</li>
<li>Composure = Calmness: The composure of the day was remarkable.</li>
</ul>

<p>We have the authority of the late Dr. Hart as to the genuineness of the
following extracts, taken from the papers of a class seeking admission
into a high-school, to which had been given a list of words for their
meanings and applications:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fabulous&mdash;Full of threads: Silk is fabulous.</li>
<li>Accession&mdash;The act of eating a great deal: John got very sick after dinner by accession.
<span class="pagenum">[Pg. 96]</span></li>
<li>Atonement&mdash;A small insect: Queen Mab was pulled by atonements.</li>
<li>Develop&mdash;To swallow up: God sent a whale to develop Jonah.</li>
<li>Circumference&mdash;Distance through the middle: Distance around the middle of the outside.</li>
<li>Mobility&mdash;Belonging to the people: The mobility of St. Louis has greatly increased.</li>
<li>Adequate&mdash;A land animal: An elephant is an adequate.</li>
<li>Gregarious&mdash;Pertaining to idols: The Sandwich-Islanders are gregarious.</li>
<li>Fluctuation&mdash;Coming in great numbers: There was a great fluctuation of immigrants.</li>
<li>Alternate&mdash;Not ternate.</li>
<li>Intrinsic&mdash;Not trinsic: weak, feeble: He was a very intrinsic old man.</li>

<p>"Many a woman whose childhood was bright with promise
    endures an after-life of misery because, through a false
    delicacy, she remained ignorant of her physical nature
    and requirements, although on all other subjects she may
    be well-informed; and so at length she goes to her grave
    mourning the hard fate that has made existence a burden,
    and perhaps wondering to what end she was born, when a
    little knowledge at the proper time would have shown her
    how to easily avoid those evils that have made her life
    a wretched failure."&mdash;<i>From Introduction.</i></p>

    <p>"A very useful book, for parents who have daughters is
    'Hygiene for Girls,' by Irenæus P. Davis, M.D.,
    published by D. Appleton &amp; Co. And it is just the book
    for an intelligent, well-instructed girl to read with
    care. It is not a text-book, nor does it bristle with
    technical terms. But it tells in simple language just
    what girls should do and not to do to preserve the
    health and strength, to realize the joys, and prepare
    for the duties of a woman's lot. It is written with a
    delicacy, too, which a mother could hardly surpass in
    talking with her daughter."&mdash;<i>Christian at Work.</i></p>
